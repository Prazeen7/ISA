        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>In 1999, we started off as the first specialty coffee shop in Nepal to specialize in <br>
            handcrafted coffee and bakery. Over the years, we have diversified from a small coffee <br>
             shop to an international franchising Nepalese Coffee Brand with more than 30 outlets <br>
             around the world.<br><br> <br>

             We believe in maintaining a sustainable business ecosystem by supporting local <br>
             farmers and Nepali products. Through continuous innovation in technology & process, <br>
             we hope to become the most inspiring Nepalese Coffee Establishment in the world <br>
             taking Nepalese Coffee and Culture to the world. <br> <br> <br>

             Himalayan Java is the first specialty coffeehouse in Nepal. With a strong core belief of<br>
              socially responsible entrepreneurship, our mission is to promote the fledgling <br>
              Nepalese coffee industry by investing in people from grower to consumer and to<br>
               create awareness of promoting Nepalese coffee domestically and in an international<br>
                niche market.
